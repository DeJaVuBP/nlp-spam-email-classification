# Spam Email Classification Using NLP

This project aims to build an effective spam email classifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By analyzing email content, the system can automatically identify and filter out unwanted spam messages, improving email security and user experience.

## Features
- Preprocessing of email text data
- Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF
- Classification using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM)
- Evaluation metrics to measure model performance

## Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- Scikit-learn, NLTK, or SpaCy libraries
